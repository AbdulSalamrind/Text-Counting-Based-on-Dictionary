## Overview

This Python script allows you to count words in an Excel spreadsheet column based on a predefined dictionary. It's a useful tool for analyzing text data and summarizing word occurrences.

## Features

- Load data from an Excel spreadsheet.
- Define a custom dictionary of words and their corresponding counts.
- Count words in a specified column.
- Display word counts based on the dictionary.

## Prerequisites

Before using the script, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas library (`pip install pandas`)
- openpyxl library (`pip install openpyxl`)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create an Excel file with a column containing the text data you want to analyze. Save it as, for example, "data.xlsx."

3. Modify the script to match your data and dictionary:
   - Set the correct file path (`file_path`) to your Excel file.
   - Define your dictionary of words and their corresponding counts.
   - Replace `"Your_Column_Name_Here"` with the actual column name containing the text.

4. Run the script using:

   ```bash
   python word_count.py
The script will count words in the specified column based on your dictionary and display the word counts.
Configuration
File Path: Replace "data.xlsx" with the path to your Excel file.
Dictionary: Modify the word_dictionary with the words you want to count.
Column Name: Replace "Your_Column_Name_Here" with the actual column name containing the text data in your Excel file.
